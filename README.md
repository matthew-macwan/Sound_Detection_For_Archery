# Sound_Detection_For_Archery

CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS 

CURRENT STAGE - researching methods for audio/one class classification.

### Project Summary 

One of my personal hobbies is archery and I love shooting arrows. However, every single time I lose count of how many arrows I shot. You don't want to overshoot because then you will develop muscle imbalances in your arms. I try to aim for 50 arrows every time I go out but I never know if I am over or under 50 arrows shot. To solve this issue, I want to develop a sound detection model that has a counter and increases the counter every time it hears the bow string snapping. 

### File Description 

Archery_Audio_EDA.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with some EDA, just viewing the video clips and audio clips and their features (something like a rough draft right now)



### Topics Covered

- audio classification, mel spectrograms, fast fourier transformation
