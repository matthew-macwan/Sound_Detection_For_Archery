# Sound_Detection_For_Archery

CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS 

CURRENT STAGE - researching methods for audio/one class classification.

### Project Summary 

One of my personal hobbies is archery and I love shooting arrows. However, every single time I lose count of how many arrows I shot. You don't want to overshoot because then you will develop muscle imbalances in your arms. I try to aim for 50 arrows every time I go out but I never know if I am over or under 50 arrows shot. To solve this issue, I want to develop a sound detection model that has a counter and increases the counter every time it hears the bow string snapping.
